# Proposal: [Project Title]

## Abstract

A short abstract that summarizes the proposal. Maximum 200 words.

## Motivation

In this section, we should write a good introduction to the background of an
individual project. The following questions should be answered as an introduction:

1. What are the problems or features included in the project?
2. Why is it interesting to *you*, or what motivates you to work on it?
3. Why it is interesting to *others*, or what attracts people to admire the work?

## Proposal

This section should discuss the core idea of a proposal, and also
addresses these question:

1. What are the planned features to implement? Explain with decent details.
2. Is the proposal related to a research paper(s)? List all of them.
3. Why this is a geometry processing related topic/project?
4. What are the existing implementations/solutions? Or if not, please indicate.
5. How exactly the project can do things differently?

Note that it is important that an implementation should be done differently than
existing ones. For instance, an existing implementation was written in C++ and OpenGL, and you may propose to implement it using TypeScript and three.js.

## Implementation

This section should discuss a concrete plan about how to implement the proposed idea.
The following question should be answered in this section:

1. What could be the development settings, e.g., programming language, possible dependencies, target platforms, etc.
2. What are the milestones for the project?
3. What issues might occur in each milestone during the implementation?
4. What are challenges might encounter?
5. How is the plan of solving all these issues and challenges?
6. What are the alternative solutions (Plan B) if the issue cannot be resolved?

## References

The reference section should list all possible resources (e.g., Research papers, blog posts, development documentation, YouTube videos, etc.) that can help to finish the implementation. All resources should be formulated in the following format and ordered by name:

- Author name. Title. Publish date. https://link.to.the/resource.
